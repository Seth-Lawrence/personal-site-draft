            Hi, I’m Seth, and I'm a software engineer and got my start in
            localization and analytics. In my previous roles, it's always
            been important to me to continually learn and grow my skills
            as well as my impact, and eventually I was writing functions
            to gather information from hundreds of thousands of lines
            of raw data and building reports from them, and determining
            strategic direction for seven-figure projects. I really
            enjoyed the increasingly technical part of my job. In one
            case I was writing algorithms to determine and find the
            user generated content with the  highest ROI for
            translation, which was later used in algorithms to determine
            which content to auto-translate.

            <br></br>
            </div>
            I also enjoy working and collaborating on a team on complex
            questions where the answer might be more complex than just
            'hey this is the right direction'. In localization there's
            also a lot of technical and design considerations, and
            that's what got me started dabbling in some different
            coding languages. I found that I really enjoyed seeing
            what I'm building come together so much that I decided
            to get more formal training to become a software engineer,
            which was a process I really enjoyed.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <div>
            At this point I want to leverage my current skills and continue
            building and working on interesting products, while also being
            in an environment where I can constantly learn and grow and
            increase my impact. I've found that I’m really passionate
            software engineering and I look forward to using my passion
            to to make a significant and positive impact.
