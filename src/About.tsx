            Hi, my name is Seth. I studied Russian and German at Ohio State, and then went on to Uni Salzburg / Bowling Green.
            I also lived in Europe (Munich, Salzburg) for two years. After school, I spent nearly 9 years at Glassdoor as a Product Analyst and People Manager on the product and
            localization/internationalization team. I have successfully led localization and internationalization projects,
            such as scaling and improving customer service responses and SLA, managing the localization marketing materials and help articles,
            algorithmically identified high ROI content for localization, and managed projects involving vendors or the integration of translation software.
            I really enjoyed the technical side the of my job and decided to make the transition from product to engineering.
